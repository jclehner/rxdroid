RxDroid - A medication reminder
===============================

**!!! Please note that development on RxDroid is currently limited to fixing bugs !!!**

RxDroid is a simple medication reminder app. Apart from reminding you to take 
your meds, it will also keep track of your pill count, warning you to get a 
refill in time.

limited permissions.

### Donate

You can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jclehner) if you want, but please consider
donating the money for charity instead - [Médecins Sans Frontiers](https://www.msf.org/donate) comes to mind,
but any other organization, local or international, that you think deserves support will do. Thank you!
